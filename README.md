# MAIS202Project_StockPredictor
This is my first Machine Learning project and it aims to find a relationship between the financials of a company, as disclosed in its annual financial statements, and how its stock performs in the following year. This project is set up as a supervised regression task.
## How to use:
To run this project yourself, you must open your command line and do the following:
- Change your current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made using `cd [dirName]`
- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/omarw99/MAIS202Project_StockPredictor.git`
- cd into the downloaded repository's directory using `cd MAIS202Project_StockPredictor`
- Run the existing shell script using `./run.sh`

Please note that you can, and should, change all the variables that are marked as changeable in [runmodel](deliverable4_runmodel.py), so the model runs appropriately. If you do so, then you can repeat the directions above, and see the model output a different result!
