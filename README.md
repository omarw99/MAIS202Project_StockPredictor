# MAIS202Project_StockPredictor
This is my first Machine Learning project and it aims to find a relationship between the financials of a company, as disclosed in its annual financial statements, and how its stock performs in the following year. This project is set up as a supervised regression task.
## How to use:
To run this project yourself, you have to download the following files in the same directory and then run them in this order:
1- [savemodel](deliverable4_savemodel.py)
2- [deploymodel](deliverable4_deploymodel.py)
3- [runmodel](deliverable4_runmodel.py)

Please note that you should change all the variables that are marked as changeable in [runmodel](deliverable4_runmodel.py), so the model runs correctly.
