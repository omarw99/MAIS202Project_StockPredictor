# MAIS202Project_StockPredictor
This is my first Machine Learning project and it aims to find a relationship between the financials of a company, as disclosed in its annual financial statements, and how its stock performs in the following year. This project is set up as a supervised regression task.

To run this project yourself, you have to download the following files in the same directory and then run them in this order:
